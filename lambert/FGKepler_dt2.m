%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% FGKepler_dt2 - Compute final state vectors (rf and vf) after a given dt
%
%   Inputs:
%       r0  - Initial position vector (km)
%       v0  - Initial velocity vector (km/s)
%       dt  - Time interval over which the state is propagated (seconds)
%       mu  - Gravitational parameter of the central body (km^3/s^2)
%
%   Outputs:
%       rf  - Final position vector after time dt (km)
%       vf  - Final velocity vector after time dt (km/s)
